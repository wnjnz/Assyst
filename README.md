# ASYS VOLUNTEER LEAD

 Asys volunteer lead is an app made by volunteers for volunteers that empowers volunteers with information to respond where they are needed the most. This helps volunteer organizations manage not only their front-line operations in disaster relief but also long-term volunteer effots.

 ##Getting Started
