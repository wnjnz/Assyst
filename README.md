# ASYS VOLUNTEER LEAD

ASYS Volunteer Lead is an app made by volunteers for volunteers. We aim to empower volunteers with information to respond effectively in disaster relief.  We help volunteer organizations manage front-line  as well as long term volunteer operations. This uses [react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and [typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript).

 ## Getting Started
